    <div style="width: 400px; text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 20px;">This page highlights some technical projects I did for fun since my time in high school. Most of the design, documentation and source codes are lost, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions about details.</div>
    <div class="projectbox">
      <div class="projecttitle">Digital clock based on Microchip PIC16F627 microcontroller</div>
      <div class="projecttext">When I was in high school, I built a four digit wall clock based on a microcontroller. I drew the PCB design using xfig, printed in on a transparency, photographed with a household UV light on a board sprayed with photosensitive material, etched in the bathroom, and drilled the holes and soldered the parts on my desk. The clock is still runing, using a wall DC adapter. When the power goes out, the controller keeps track of the time using a built-in battery, without powering the LEDs. I wrote the control program in Assembly. It supports 12/24 hour formats, and dimming using pulse width modulation.</div>
      <div class="projecttext">TODO: a photo of the outside, inside, scan of transparency if I find out, source code if I find it.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="projectbox">
      <div class="projecttitle">Low-budget remote position sensor for classroom demonstation of mechanics experiments</div>
      <div class="projecttext">Another high school project was inspired by an off-the-shelf educational equipment called V-Scope. The V-Scope is able to measure the position of a small button attached to a mechanical experiment (like a pendulum) using three receiving towers. The system periodically sends infrared signals to the button, which in turn emits ultrasound. By measuring how long it takes the sound to reach each tower, the system calculates the three-dimensional position of the button.</div>
      <div class="projecttext">I developed a similar system, one dimensional only, that fits in the budget of Hungarian high schools. It is a quartz crystal based beeping device, which is recorded by a microphone attached to a computer. Such a device can be put together for less than one hundredth of the price of a V-Scope. I wrote a program to measure the phase shift of the beep in small time windows, and thus calculate the displacement with respect to the previous window. A small error in the frequency translates into a virtual velocity component, which can be fitted for and removed.</div>
      <div class="projecttext">The first question I get is that if the device is moving, the beep gets Doppler-shifted, therefore the software will not be able to pick it up. Unfortunately I was not able to answer this question convincingly in high school, except by demonstrating that the device really worked. However, now I understand that by choosing a narrow time window, that is, multiplying the input signal with a short top-hat window function, what happens in Fourier-space is that the spectrum gets convolved with the Fourier-transform of the window function. That is, the shorter the time window, the more spread out the frequency. We just need to tune the window to be narrow enough to accomodate the highest velocity in the experiment, but wide enough not to yield too noisy results.</div>
      <div class="projecttext">TODO: example graphs and source code, if I find any of it.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="projectbox">
      <div class="projecttitle">LIRC receiver</div>
      <div class="projecttext">Around the time I graduated from high school, I built an infrared receiver to be able to remote control the media player on my computer with an infrared remote via the software <a href="http://lirc.org">lirc</a>.</div>
      <div class="projecttext">TODO: photo, .lirc example if I find it.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="projectbox">
      <div class="projecttitle">Tandem</div>
      <div class="projecttext">I bought two used road bikes to build a tandem. Welding professionals at my university shop showed me how to use their tungsten inert gas welding equipment, but were kind enough to let me do most of the work. The most difficult part was to find a distributor that could provide me with two pieces of filler material, which is usually sold in boxes of many kilograms.</div>
      <div class="projecttext">TODO: photos.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="projectbox">
      <div class="projecttitle">Object-oriented chomp</div>
      <div class="projecttext"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomp">Chomp</a> is a poset game in which two players take turns breaking off a rectangular piece from a bar of chocolate. The one left with the bottom right corner loses. I recently implemented this game in Python as an excercise in object-oriented programming: <a href="chomp.tar.bz2">source code</a>, <a href="chomp.png">screenshot</a>.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="projectbox">
      <div class="projecttitle">Loops in singly linked lists</div>
      <div class="projecttext">A friend of mine got this question at a job interview with Microsoft: How do you tell if a linked list has a loop in it? They also told me about two possible algorithms, and I decided to code it just for fun. Here is the <a href="list.tar.bz2">source code</a>.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="projectbox">
      <div class="projecttitle">Bicycle gears</div>
      <div class="projecttext">Did you ever wonder how many gears on the rear derailleur is upshifting by one gear on the front equivalent to? Or what is the ratio between the lowest and the highest gear combinations? My next fun project is to visualize gear combinations on a graph that lets you answer these questions.</div>
      <div class="projecttext">TODO: implement.</div>
