### My personal website.

Finally I realized that version control is the best thing that can happen to my
website.  This website is currently available at the following locations:

- [bencebeky.github.io](http://bencebeky.github.io), this repository directly through
  [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).
- [www.cfa.harvard.edu/~bbeky](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~bbeky/) at Harvard,
  manually updated.  Currently this hosts two large .mp4 files.  This site will
  be removed 2014 summer.
- [math.bme.hu/~bnc](http://math.bme.hu/~bnc) at BME, manually updated.
